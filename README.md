# nextvsnuxt
did a small challenge to decide whether I want to start building more projects in NextJS or NuxtJS

# I picked Nuxt hopee I don't regret that.
Nuxt was more person oriented so I feel like it will eventuually let me build projects in a much simpler way. Stay tuned, as I build more projects with this framework.

I be streaming on twitch; @ twitch.com/toluafo

tune in pls and thx
